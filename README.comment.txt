This is the Java SE practices respository powered by
<a href="https://github.com/briansalehi/milestone.git">Milestone</a> project.

Read all the practice pages from the beginning through the end and try to
write code and run yourself.

All topics are splitted in different chapters, some maybe nested.
And each page represents a detail of a topic.
Reviewing all pages might take a while but make sure you study and write their
code yourself at least once a week in order to keep your hands warm on coding
Java!

Contributions are always welcome!
