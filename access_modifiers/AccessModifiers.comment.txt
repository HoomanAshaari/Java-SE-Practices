There are 4 access modifiers in Java, by which each member of class that use them, would have different type of accessibility:
<ol>
    <li><b>Public:</b> Accessible everywhere (keyword: public)</li>
    <li><b>Protected:</b> Accessible in class (itself), class children, and other classes in the same package. (keyword: protected)</li>
    <li><b>Package Private/Default: </b> Only in the same package. (keyword: this one actually doesn't have any keywords, so you just have to write nothing as access modifier, and then Java assumes that member as a package-private)</li>
    <li><b>Private:</b> Only in the current class (even not accessible in children) (keyword: private)</li>
</ol>



</br>
</br>
<b>* Protected and Package-private members are not accessible in sub-packages of current package, and they are only accessible in the current package.</b>
</br>
<b>* Access modifiers are part of method signature. </b>
