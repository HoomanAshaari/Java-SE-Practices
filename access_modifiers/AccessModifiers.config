## Whether source can be executed either as compiled source or interpretable
## Set to false for text files

## Whether source should be compiled
## Set false for scripting languages

## Order of statements in compilation command
## Available statements: compiler, options, object, source, headers
#COMPILATION_SCHEME="compiler options object source"

## Whether all sources in one line of .index file should appear in linkage
## usually other files are headers only and won't need to be linked to source
#INCLUDES=false

## What is the extension of the object which compiler throws?
## Default is set to .o
#OUTPUT_OBJECT=

## Whether object should be linked after compilation too
## Defaut is set to true
## Set false for scripts
