While using wrapper classes, we could face two of famous Java functionalities:
<ol>
    <li>Auto-Boxing: Java creates an object using its Auto-boxing functionality, while we want to assign a primitive type to a wrapper-class object. so we don't need to use "new" keyword.</li>
    <li>Unboxing: It is exactly the opposite of what happens in Auto-boxing. It converts a wrapper-class object to a primitive type.</li>
</ol>

You can find how these two work in the code section.
