As you know there are two main types of variables in Java: 1) Primitive-types   2) Reference types

Primitive-types are categorized in 8 groups:
boolean, byte, short, int, long, float, double, char

Everything in java is an object from a class, EXCEPT primitive-types. In this case we could use wrapper classes to have primitive types as an object.
As they are objects from classes, we have handy methods within these variables. (there is no method available for variables made from primitive types).

You can see these wrappers here:

 <table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>Primitive type</th>
    <th>Wrapper class</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>boolean</td>
    <td>Boolean</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>byte</td>
    <td>Byte</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>short</td>
    <td>Short</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>int</td>
    <td>Int</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>long</td>
    <td>Long</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>float</td>
    <td>Float</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>double</td>
    <td>Double</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>char</td>
    <td>Char</td>
  </tr>
</table> 

Example of constructing from each case is in the code section.
