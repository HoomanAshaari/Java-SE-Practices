When we are creating an object using new (e.g. SampleClass sampleClass = new SampleClass(1, 2);),
following steps happen step by step consecutively:
<b>* so pay attention that constructor is not the first thing that would get called after using  new  keyword,
actually it is the last step.</b>

1) Static inline initialization
2) Static variables (sets them with default value)
3) static blocks

4) Inline initialization
5) variables initialization (non-static variables) (sets them with default value)
6) Non-static blocks

7) Final initialization (constructor)
